            "So then what happened?\n",
            "When they became executives, did they morph into other beings—types of people that needed financial incentives to work hard?\n",
            "How could we see something so fundamental in such different ways?\n",
            "The paper, which has been one of the most widely cited of the past three decades, focused on a problem known as agency theory, or incentive theory : why don’t managers always behave in a way that is in the best interest of shareholders?\n",

            "Periodically, as we were all considering our postgraduation plans, we’d try to keep ourselves honest, challenging each other: “What about doing something important, or something you really love?\n",

            "Why?\n",
            "Gloria Steinem framed strategy for her world as Andy Grove did for his: “We can tell our values by looking at our checkbook stubs.” The dilemma of what machine to pull out of a salesperson’s bag is very similar to the dilemma we all face near the end of a workday: do I spend another half hour at work to get something extra done, or do I go home and play with my children?\n",
            "How should we devote our resources to each of these pursuits?\n",
            "How do you make sure that you’re implementing the strategy you truly want to implement?\n",
            "You might think you are a charitable person, but how often do you really give your time or money to a cause or an organization that you care about?\n",

            "Whoever makes the most noise?\n",
            "Whoever grabs you first?\n",
            "And who wouldn’t want the ability to call her father in Baltimore when she stands triumphant on top of Mount Everest?\n",

            "Do you want it chocolatier?\n",
            "Cheaper?\n",
            "So they stood in a restaurant hours on end, taking very careful data: What time did people buy these milkshakes?\n",
            "What were they wearing?\n",
            "Were they alone?\n",
            "Did they buy other food with it?\n",
            "Did they eat it in the restaurant or drive off with it?\n",
            "But I felt so guilty about eating candy for breakfast that I never did it again.”  But a milkshake?\n",
            "If our fast-food chain asked me, “So, Clay … how can we improve the milkshake so that you’ll buy more of them?\n",

            "They have a job of wanting to feel like a good parent: see all the opportunities I’m providing for my child?\n",
            "Are the children developing from these experiences the deep, important processes such as teamwork, entrepreneurship, and learning the value of preparation?\n",
            "Or are they just going along for the ride?\n",
            "When we so heavily focus on providing our children with resources, we need to ask ourselves a new set of questions: Has my child developed the skill to develop better skills?\n",
            "The knowledge to develop deeper knowledge?\n",
            "The experience to learn from his experiences?\n",
            "How could this be?\n",
            "The conundrum was this: given that every last part of it had been replaced, was it still Theseus’s ship?\n",
            "The Athenians still called it Theseus’s Ship … but was it?\n",
            "I want to turn that into a similar philosophical question for you: if your children gain their priorities and values from other people … whose children are they?\n",
            "But how do you equip your kids with the right capabilities?\n",
            "[]  Is It Really the Right Stuff?\n",
            "If finding the right stuff is a good way to identify top talent, why is it so common to see executives with a successful track record in one company coming into another company with great fanfare—only to be quickly dubbed a failure and ushered out?\n",
            "Several years ago, in a major executive education program for over a thousand senior leaders from a variety of companies, I asked by survey this question: “Of all of the people that you hired or promoted into positions of (defined) responsibility in your company since you’ve had your current responsibility, what percentage of them turned out to be a superb choice?\n",
            "What percentage is performing adequately?\n",
            "So if a “right stuff” screen doesn’t predict future success, what does?\n",
            "A Course for Just Five Players  Does that mean that we should never hire or promote an inexperienced manager who had not already learned to do what needs to be done in this assignment?\n",

            "What do you think will happen next time your child is late on a project?\n",
            "But here’s the question: how do we make sure that happens?\n",
            "How Does Culture Form in a Company?\n",
            "Would that still be a “casual” culture?\n",
            "You can tell the health of a company’s culture by asking, “When faced with a choice on how to do something, did employees make the decision that the culture ‘wanted’ them to make?\n",
            "Is that okay?\n",
            "When one comes running to you in tears, how do you respond?\n",
            "Do you automatically punish the other child?\n",
            "Do you tell the crying child to shake it off?\n",
            "Do you call both of them together and punish both of them?\n",
            "Do you say you won’t get involved?\n",
            "And if you don’t?\n",
            "What does your family value?\n",

            "Generosity?\n",
            "Humility?\n",
            "What do the kids know they have to do that will get their parents to say, “Well done”?\n",
            "What I offer here is a theory called “full versus marginal thinking” that will help you answer our final question: how can I be sure I live a life of integrity?\n",
            "After all, how many people do you know who believe they do not have integrity?\n",
            "Set against this backdrop, a little upstart called Netflix emerged in the 1990s with a novel idea: rather than make people go to the video store, why don’t we mail DVDs to them?\n",
            "Compared to that, Netflix was very happy with their relatively low margins and their “niche market.”  So, who was right?\n",
            "And Blockbuster?\n",
            "Who would go for that?\n",
            "The right way to look at this new market was not to think, “How can we protect our existing business?” Instead, Blockbuster should have been thinking: “If we didn’t have an existing business, how could we best build a new one?\n",
            "“Why should we build a new mill?\n",
            "We need to leverage our existing sales team.”  Or I would say, “You know that brand of yours?\n",
            "We need to leverage one of our existing brands.”  The language of the disruptive attackers was completely different: “It’s time to create the sales force” and “It’s time to build a brand.”  Hence, the paradox: Why is it that the big, established companies that have so much capital find these initiatives to be so costly?\n",
            "And why do the small entrants with much less capital find them to be straightforward?\n",
            "How could hiding one mistake from his bosses end up leading to the undoing of a 233-year-old merchant bank, a conviction and imprisonment for fraud, and ultimately the failure of his marriage?\n",
            "The next step is always a small one, and given what you’ve already done, why stop now?\n",
            "Why?\n",
            "Even though theory is able to predict the possible outcomes of an important decision, on what basis would the executives be deciding among them to determine which is the best outcome?\n",
            "How do you become so deeply committed to these things that they guide what you prioritize on a daily basis—to drive what you will do, and what you will not do?\n",
            "Was this actually true?\n",
            "And what did it imply for my life?\n",
            "But what is universal is that your intent must be to answer this question: who do I truly want to become?\n",
